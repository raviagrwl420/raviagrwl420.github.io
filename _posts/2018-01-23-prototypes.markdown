## Introduction

Prototyping is an integral part of the iterative design process. It facilitates communication of conceptual designs among the stakeholders of a project including but not limited to the designers, developers and users. It also provides an efficient way to explore and evaluate various design alternatives early in the development cycle without committing large amount of resources. Although the prototypes created as part of the development process may serve a common goal like usability testing, they often differ in form and function. The prototypes may be classified as low-fidelity or high-fidelity depending on the interactivity and completeness of the prototype. The fidelity of the prototype is determined by the degree to which it accurately represents the appearance and interaction of the final product, not the degree to which the code and other attributes invisible to the user are accurate<sup>2</sup>.

### Low-fidelity Prototypes

Low-fidelity prototypes have limited functionality and interactivity. They are quick, easy and cheap to build and are often used very early in the development cycle. They can be efficiently used to depict design concepts and explore different design directions without much investment in the development. An example of a low-fidelity prototype is a paper-pencil mock-up that shows the general flow through the application screens.

### High-fidelity Prototypes

High-fidelity prototypes are nearly fully interactive and accurately represent the core functionality of the product's interface. They typically involve some programming effort and specialized tools to build which can often be time consuming. However, they can be built to accurately represent the final product and can even be so realistic that a user is unable to tell them apart from the actual product.

### Low-fidelity vs. High-fidelity Prototypes

One of the main trade-offs between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes is the required resources and the resulting benefits. Low-fidelity prototypes require lesser time, cost and effort to build as compared to high-fidelity prototypes but on the other hand, they may provide limited error checking. Walker et al. studied the effectiveness of low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes and the medium of the prototype i.e. paper or computer on usability testing<sup>3</sup>. They found little difference between computer and paper media, or low- and high-fidelity which is consistent with previous studies comparing low- and high-fidelity prototypes. Thus low-fidelity prototypes can be better for usability testing due to the lower resource requirement. Low-fidelity prototypes can however be deemed unprofessional by some clients.

Low-fidelity prototypes can be efficiently used to evaluate multiple design concepts whereas it would be a waste of resources to build multiple high-fidelity prototypes. As low-fidelity prototypes are easy to build, they can be constructed early in the development cycle thus facilitating their use for communication and identification of market requirements. However, building a high-fidelity prototype without initial requirements gathering might itself be cumbersome. As you need little or no programming skill for building low-fidelity prototypes it may be used effectively for *interactive prototyping*. Interactive prototyping is a form of participatory design where the prototype is developed on the fly as a test user comments on its weak spots<sup>1</sup>.

In contrast to low-fidelity prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes provide close to complete functionality and are fully interactive. This enables these prototypes to be user-driven unlike low-fidelity prototypes which rely on a facilitator to support the user's interaction with the prototype as it often has navigational and flow limitations. Users are thus not able to get a first-hand experience of how the prototype operates. Hence, low-fidelity prototypes may not be suitable for measurement studies which often need the user to be in control of the application.

As the high-fidelity prototypes almost accurately represent the eventual product, they can provide a living specification for the programmers and information developers. With high-fidelity prototypes, it may also be possible to reuse certain parts of the code in the final product unlike low-fidelity prototypes which have limited utility after requirements are established. High-fidelity prototypes can even be used as a marketing or sales tool to elicit user interest and encourage customer buy-in before the product is ready. Crucial feedback gathered can be used to fine-tune the prototype and the changes can be included in the final product increasing user satisfaction.

There are some issues with high-fidelity prototyping too. Building high-fidelity prototypes may become a development effort in itself and the designers may be reluctant to change designs and less likely to fully explore the design space. Customers may feel that the product is ready and may demand it immediately if it is significantly better than their current system. The developers might consider high-fidelity prototyping as a duplication of effort. Also, the detail provided by a high-fidelity prototype may often be extraneous to the more important issues at hand.

### Conclusion

A comparison of the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototyping methods was presented here. After a careful consideration, we can safely say that both ways of prototyping have certain advantages and disadvantages at which point it becomes a matter of practical considerations and the task at hand. One should then consider the requirements from a prospective prototype while deciding on one type of prototype over the other.
