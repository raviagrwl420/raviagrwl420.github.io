## Introduction

For a long time, design and research have been regarded as separate endeavors - the former residing in industrial practice and craft, the latter in academic experiments and reflection<sup>3</sup>. Frayling, in his paper titled "Research in art and design"<sup>4</sup>, challenged this widespread stereotypical perception and coined the term - *research through art and design* to identify research achieved and communicated through the activities of art, craft or design. Realizing the need for a formalized model, Zimmerman et al. <sup>1</sup> proposed a new model for interaction design research based on the Frayling's idea of *research through design*. The HCI community has since adopted *research through design* or design-based research to accommodate research contributions where the design activities and artifacts are the principal components in the process of generating and communicating knowledge. In this post, we discuss the proposed benefits of *research through design*.

### Benefits of *research through design*

The research community has relied on empirical and theoretical research methods for the longest time, however, these methods have some serious limitations. It is significantly challenging to apply these methods if the problem is under-constrained or the scope of the problem is too large. Moreover isolated analysis often does not capture the real-world context and is sometimes unrealistically simplified undermining its utility.

Design-based research tries to address these issues through its process of iterative problem solving. Through an active process of ideating, iterating, and continually critiquing potential solutions, design researchers continually reframe the problem as they attempt to make the *right* thing<sup>1</sup>. The outcome of this research activity is a concrete framing of the problem and a description of the preferred state, along with a series of artifacts - models, prototypes, products, and documentation of the design process. Here we try to outline some benefits of the *research through design* approach.

#### Helps address under-constrained problems}

By engaging in design-based research, we can better understand real-world, ill-defined, and under-constrained or wicked problems<sup>2</sup>. Design often relies on intuition and tacit knowledge that help in understanding a real-world problem. Moreover its iterative process makes it easy to continually refine the problem framing and attempt to find the *right* thing which makes design-based research suitable for under-constrained problems. Such problems are challenging to be solved via empirical or theoretical research methods.

#### Helps identify opportunities

One of the major benefits of *research through design* is that it can help identify research opportunities that can have a significant impact on the world. It can help envision the preferred state of the world and thus inspire and motivate a multitude of researchers to channel their efforts towards realizing the *right* thing. It can also help find gaps in theory, and unexpected behavior to identify opportunities for improvement in behavioral theory.

#### Facilitates efficient communication

The design artifacts created as a part of *research through design* provide a forum for continued discussion among the research, practice, and education communities. They provide a rich context and facilitate efficient communication of the framing of the problem, and the applied theories, models and technologies. Several research artifacts may be analyzed to find similar design approaches addressing common problems in search for generalizable patterns.

#### Takes a holistic approach

The use of *research through design* approach results in a holistic research contribution that reveals the framing of the problem and the balance the researchers have made between the intersecting and conflicting perspectives<sup>1</sup>. In such a situation, the novelty is not in building individual components, but in the novel integration of various research contributions from a variety of disciplines, into a single working system.

### Conclusion

We discussed *research through design* and some important benefits that it brings to the table as an alternative research method. Design-based research expands the domain of research inquiry and possible research contributions thus complimenting the existing empirical research methods in the quest for new knowledge.
