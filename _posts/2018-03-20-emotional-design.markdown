## Introduction

In the last decade or so, we have made great strides in our endeavour to create usable interfaces. But as Aarron Walter puts it in his book "Designing for emotion"<sup>2</sup>, it's a pretty low bar for interface design. Through an analogy, he explains how we designing usable interfaces is similar to a chef cooking edible food. Sure, we want our food to be edible and it to have a certain nutritional value, but we also crave for taste and flavor. Why should pleasure be a priority when it comes to a top culinary experience but not so much in the case of user experience? Why should we settle for usable when we can make interfaces both usable and pleasurable? These are some genuine questions to ask.

### User experience and emotions

We often think of user experience as something that determines and governs a person's experience of a product or an interface. But it is not the product or the interface that defines a user's experience, is it? It is the user's own behavior, attitudes, feelings, and emotions. While we cannot directly design a person's experience of something, we must acknowledge the role that emotions play in the experience. Once we do, we have already taken our first step towards understanding what user experience really is. And then we can make a further effort to ensure that a person's experience of a product is a positive one by following a user-centered design approach.

### Emotion in interface design

The purpose of emotion in interface design is to elicit appropriate emotional responses in order to create a desired experience for the user. However, it should not be so overpowering that it distracts them from the task at hand. Instead it should encourage them to take necessary action and move forward in their tasks. We need to consider emotions when designing user interfaces in order to:

#### Make things work better

We know from previous studies that positive emotions are critical to learning, curiosity, and creative thought. Whereas when people are anxious they tend to narrow their thought processes, concentrating upon aspects directly relevant to a problem. Thus the emotional state that a user is in greatly impacts the user's experience when using an interface and ultimately how it works. In a positive emotional state, users are more likely to think creatively thus making it easier for them to find solutions to the problems they encounter. On the other hand, a negative state leads people to focus more on problematic details thereby increasing their frustration. In Norman's words, designers can get away with more if the product is fun and enjoyable <sup>1</sup>.

#### To affect or account for users emotional state

In some scenarios, like when designing something critical like a control room for a nuclear power plant, it may be necessary to have a neutral or a slightly negative feel to keep people aroused and focused. In a dangerous situation, it may even be necessary to alter the emotional state of the users through anxiety producing alarms. In another example, it may be necessary to factor in the emotional state of the users in an emergency situation like a plane crash or fire in order to design effective emergency exit systems.

#### Form a long term bonding

Through positive emotional stimuli, one can increases the perceived value of a product and build a sense of trust and engagement with the users. We cherish emotional experiences and they often leave a lasting imprint on our memory. We tend to form a long term bonding and relationship with people or things that make us feel better.

### Conclusion

The interfaces that we design must first be functional, reliable, and usable, but then we also need to push our boundaries to try and make them pleasurable. It is a goal that we, as designers, must aim and strive for. It is only through emotional design, that we can achieve truly great user experience.
